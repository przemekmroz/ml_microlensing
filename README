Identifying microlensing events using neural networks

Calculating light curve features:

gcc -o get_features get_features.c find_transient.c single.c asa047.c -lm

./get_feature filename

filename should contain three columns: time, magnitude, and magnitude
error.

Normalized features are saved to a text file "normalized_features.txt"
which can be fed into a classifier.

To calculate the classifier's score use:

python predict.py CLASSIFIER.h5 normalized_features.txt
